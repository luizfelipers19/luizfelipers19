### My name is Luiz Felipe. I'm from Brazil :brazil: , and I'm passionate about technology :computer: and games :video_game:!

Computer Science is my major at UNICAMP, with a Bachelor's in Informations Systems, and I love to explore new technologies and discover new skills. Since I was a child, I am totally passionate about Visual Effects (I'm a huge fan of Star Wars! âš¡), which led me into an autodidact path of exploring how dynamic things were made, experimenting and studying technologies, until I had my first contact w/ programming in High School. 

During College, I found the opportunity to immerse myself into the Computer Graphics and Software Engineering area, which leveraged my problem solving skills, attention to details, and systematic and algebraic thinking,  helping me to get a good step towards learning Front-End and Back-End Development, as well as Data Analysis and AI knowledge I've acquired in books and classes through my academic journey. ðŸ˜„


 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently practicing to improve my skills in:
